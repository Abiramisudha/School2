              <p class="list-group-items-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">1. Accuracy Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance management systems ensure accurate time records and minimize the inevitable and costly errors with manual data entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data.
                2. Economics Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? It saves money by putting an end to inaccurate time reporting, buddy punching, absenteeism, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter of fact, a study done by the Axsium Group found that large organizations save up to $1,600 per employee after implementing automated attendance management systems.
                3. Productivity / Efficiency Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be a time-consuming, laborious, and expensive affair. It takes time to process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authorize leave and overtime, and create payroll manually. Free up precious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing information into your payroll system. The time and effort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of resources which lead to increased productivity and improves profits.

<p>Online Parent Tracking
  Another fantastic benefit of QuickSchool’s attendance feature is that the students attendance information is available to parents immediately. Once a teacher saves the attendance record for the period, QuickSchools automatically posts the attendance information to the appropriate Parent Portal without any further action from teachers. Parents can check in with the school through the Parent Portal once a day, once a week, or even period-by-period to ensure their students are attending their classes.
  
  It is another way that QuickSchools helps keep parents actively involved in their student’s education.</p>
